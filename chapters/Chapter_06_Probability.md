> The lays of probability, so true in general, so fallacious in particular

> -- Edward Gibbon
It is hard to do data science without some sort of understanding of probability and its mathematics. As with our treatment of statistics in [Chapter 5](), we’ll wave our hands a lot and elide many of the technicalities.
For our purposes you should think of probability as a way of quantifying the uncer‐ tainty associated with events chosen from a some universe of events. Rather than get‐ ting technical about what these terms mean, think of rolling a die. The universe consists of all possible outcomes. And any subset of these outcomes is an event; for example, “the die rolls a one” or “the die rolls an even number.”
Notationally, we write P E ￼ to mean “the probability of the event E.”
We’ll use probability theory to build models. We’ll use probability theory to evaluate
models. We’ll use probability theory all over the place.
One could, were one so inclined, get really deep into the philosophy of what probabil‐
ity theory means. (This is best done over beers.) We won’t be doing that.
